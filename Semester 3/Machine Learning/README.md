Data Sets being used for are as follows : 

1) instagram dataset.csv = Design a simple machine learning model to train the training instances and test the same
2) ws.csv = Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file
3) heart.csv = Perform Data Loading, Feature selection (Principal Component analysis) and Feature Scoring and Ranking
4) sport.csv = For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.
5) spam.csv = Write a program to implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.
6) iris.csv = Write a program to implement Decision Tree and Random forest with Prediction, Test Score and Confusion Matrix
7) titanic_train.csv = For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file implement Logistic Regression algorithm
8) dataset.csv = Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
9) DS4.csv = Write a program to construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease Data Set.
10) DS4.csv = Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naïve Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task.
